Fresh hello-world Gatsby build.

Dev Notes
• Viewing the assets, I see that I'll need a homepage, a contact page, and a products page.
• Starting to build the homepage. Using the Mobile layout.
• I'll need a header - no navigation present, I may add one anyway. Or not to show a point ;).
• Next is the Hero section.
    • I'm glad there's a without-text bob picture option
    • Hero image is 1.61 MB as a png. Reduced size by over 267% (down to 60.2 KB) by saving as a medium quality jpg. Will have to re-optimize all image assets. ugh.
    • All pictures will have to be renamed as well. They can't have spaces.
        • Juice Head - 5k - Watermelon Lime - PNG should be juicehead-5k-Watermelon_lime or juice_head-5k-Watermelon_lime-png
    • Trim the pictures if they are a png!
    • Don't worry about saving any svgs. Turns out I'm not using them. Also, I don't need images/svgs of any text.
• Homepage is done. He gon' learn today!
• Starting on Featured Products page
    • The product pictures should be resized to all be the same height after being trimmed.
        • If saving as a jpg, add a 100px-200px height padding. Make the width match. Square images!
    • May need to rework the mobile layout.
